### Hi, my name is Agus 👨🏽‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I use GitHub for my side projects or just to play around with code. You can also find some of my university projects in here, like my final degree projects.

### What I do
🕖 **Full-time:** I'm a Software Engineer at EY wavespace™. I'm involved in the development and maintenance of the SIRE platform, which is a document intelligence tool that enables automatic processing of documents and information extraction through ML and NLP. I provide technological leadership, helping colleages understand the importance of clean code, testing and performance. I also participate in the DevOps deployment chain, helping to reduce the overhead of new releases to production.

🪚 **Side projects:** I'm currently learning SwiftUI and hopefully will launch an app to the App Store soon. I have managed to launch to the Play Store a basic app that transpose chords/notes to different keys, it helps musicians to alter their songs (I use it a lot with my band) [link to the Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=es.esy.agvs.everynote). 

🏖 **Non work:** I love music! I like to play the guitar to disconnect from work, I even compose and record my own tunes. I also enjoy walking and movies with friends.
